# How to clone a GitHub repository onto your computer ?

1️⃣ Make sure Git is installed
Check:
git --version
If it’s not installed:
•	Download from 👉 https://git-scm.com/downloads
•	Install and keep default options

2️⃣ Copy the repository URL
On GitHub:
1.	Open the repository page
2.	Click Code
3.	Copy the HTTPS URL
(looks like: https://github.com/ressoheweb/kenzaweb24-test.git)

3️⃣ Clone the repo
Open Terminal (macOS/Linux) or Command Prompt / PowerShell (Windows)

git clone https://github.com/ressoheweb/kenzaweb24-test.git

This creates a new folder with the repo name.
